# 🍕 Pizzeria Management App

**A web-based application for managing a pizza restaurant, built as my first PHP backend project.**  
It simulates real-world operations such as order processing, inventory tracking, and staff management.

## 📌 Overview

This project is a **PHP and SQL Server** application designed to help manage a pizza restaurant.  
It was developed as my first backend project to learn PHP, server-side logic, and database interactions.  
The app allows users to:

- Manage customer orders.
- Track pizza inventory and stock levels.
- Manage staff and roles.
- Process and update order statuses.

## ⚙️ Notes

- This was a learning project, so the frontend is minimal and focuses on PHP backend logic.
- The database uses SQL Server; you can adapt it to MySQL or SQLite if needed.
- Security, authentication, and advanced features were kept simple for educational purposes.
